# A Minecraft clone made with Unity

This is a fork of [this repo, by Jin Yuhan](https://github.com/Jin-Yuhan/MinecraftClone-Unity).
I plan to replace Minecraft copyrighted assets, and add my own twist to it.
For now, it remains a pretty great copy of Minecraft!

You can create a new block or item without writing any code! Some complex block logic only needs to be written using C# scripts.

(Sorry, Jin Yuhan. The LUA caused more problems than it solved for me.)
